            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <span>
              We believe the future is cloud and we want to be part of it.
              <br />
              <br />
              We are frustrated at other companies charging a very high price to
              get a cloud virtual machine set up and running. Moreover, the
              servers offered by them will be running on weaker and
              energy-efficient CPUs to save cost, resulting in a poorly
              performing VM. We want to change that. We want to provide
              high-quality and high-performance cloud at a very competitive
              price. Backup and tools will also be included at no extra charge
              to provide the best to our customers.
              <br />
              <br />
              No compromises!

            <h2>History</h2>
            <span>
              The founder/ director of Evoxt has a lot of interest in virtual
              machines and has been playing and working on them since 2015. In
              2017, he was hired by a team that needed some virtual machines set
              up. At first, it is about deploying and managing virtual machines.
              A few years later, he decided to make this a business and founded
              Evoxt. On 20th Jan of 2020, the domain, Evoxt.com was registered
              hence starting the cloud virtual machine company, which becomes
              Evoxt today.

              competitive price.
