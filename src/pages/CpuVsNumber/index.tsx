          <h1>CPU Clock Speed vs Number of CPU Cores</h1>
          <p>
            Should I choose a CPU with a higher clock speed but with a lesser
            number of cores or a CPU with a lower clock speed but with a higher
            number of cores?
            <br />
            <br />
            This is a question that most people are always struggling with when
            choosing a CPU or deploying a server. Let's clear this up once and
            for all.
          </p>
          <h3>What about CPU Clock Speed?</h3>
          <p>
            In modern computing technology, most CPU has multiple processor
            cores that enable you to complete multiple tasks at once.
            <br />
            The ability to run multiple programs concurrently and process
            multiple tasks such as editing a document, running a script while
            debugging your programs simultaneously.
            <br />
            This is made possible with multiple processor core units.
          </p>
          <h3>What about CPU Clock Speed?</h3>
          <p>
            CPU clock speed is a measuring term for how fast can the CPU process
            pieces of information and instructions. Higher clock speed means
            faster CPU speed. This means that if you have multiple processes
            running, a CPU with a higher clock speed will process the tasks
            quicker than the other with a lower clock speed.
            <br />
            <br />A higher clock speed allows tasks to be completed faster,
            making the experience quicker and less waiting time than slower
            clock speed.
          </p>
          <h3>CPU Clock Speed vs Number of CPU Cores</h3>
          <p>
            So should I choose a CPU with a higher clock speed but with a lesser
            number of cores or a CPU with a lower clock speed but with a higher
            number of cores?
            <br />
            Unfortunately, this isn't that easy. The answer is, it depends.
            <br />
            This depends on the program, the number of processes you are looking
            to run, and how you run the program.
            <br />
            Let's consider some cases.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Case 1:</strong>
            <br />
            Running a single program at once.
            <br />
            In this case, this depends on the program. Will the program utilizes
            multiple cores?
            <br />A program that doesn't utilize multiple cores will require a
            higher clock speed to complete the task faster, while if a program
            that utilizes multiple threads, getting a higher number of cores can
            complete the process just as fast. However, if you are only looking
            to run a single process, the more efficient and safer way is to get
            a higher clock speed as there will be no guessing around and
            researching required.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Case 2:</strong>
            <br />
            Running multiple programs at once.
            <br />
            Suppose you are looking to run multiple processes at once. A CPU
            with more cores can run multiple processes at the same time, even if
            it takes longer for the task to complete, running multiple tasks at
            once, of course, will be quicker. While in a single-core but higher
            clock speed processor, the CPU will only run a process once at a
            time but quicker.
            <br />
            In this case, getting a multi-core processor with a lower clock
            speed might be better.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Case 3:</strong>
            <br />
            Need a process to complete as quickly as possible.
            <br />
            In this case, you will have no choice but to choose a processor with
            a higher clock speed.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Some real-life examples:</strong>
            <br />
            1) Game servers – Game servers usually will benefit from higher
            clock speed as most game servers only utilize a single thread at a
            time.
            <br />
            2) Website process – Both can work in this case. This will depend on
            the traffic. If the traffic is small and usually only serves several
            visitors, a higher clock speed might be beneficial in this case.
            <br />
            3) Windows Machine – It is almost impossible to run Windows OS
            smoothly with a single core that is lesser than 3.0 GHz clock speed.
            <br />
            4) Video Editing – Video editing requires a lot of CPU processing
            power. To render video faster, choose a CPU with a higher clock
            speed
            <br />
            5) Energy-saving – Lower clock speed processors consume lesser
            energy compared to higher clock speed processors. If the electricity
            bill is what you care about and not the processing speed. Choose a
            lower clock speed.
            <br />
            <br />
            The ideal, of course, will be a higher number of cores and high
            clock speed. Unfortunately, this will comes at a considerable cost…
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>Why choose Evoxt?</strong>
            <br />A higher core count with low clock speed will be cheaper and
            more profitable for providers as the most cost-efficient processors
            have a lower clock speed but a higher core count.
            <br />
            Most providers also hide the fact that they use low clock speed and
            charge you based on the number of cores, as that is the more obvious
            marketing strategy and cost-saving tactic.
            <br />
            In virtual machines, where every core matters, getting a higher
            clock speed is more beneficial.
            <br />
            If you can only choose 2 cores, will you choose 2 cores with a lower
            clock speed or a higher clock speed?
            <br />
            This is where Evoxt comes in! Evoxt seeks long-term happy customers
            and customer satisfaction, so Evoxt offers CPU cores with a higher
            clock speed, and we match the prices of providers that offer a lower
            clock speed.
            <br />
            <br />
            How awesome is Evoxt.
